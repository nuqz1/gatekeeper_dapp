Automatic Gatekeeper Tokencreation for CMv2 (Candymachine V2)

1. Create a basic react app and replace the contents off App.js and run it locally
2. Install Tampermonkey script Civic Generator
3. Install Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recaptcha-autoclick/caahalkghnhbabknipmconmbicpkcopl
4. Install Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buster-captcha-solver-for/mpbjkejclgfgadiemmefgebjfooflfhl
5. Open your app with your private key attached as base58: http://localhost:3000/?42VTj2ldkhKiRnvgdkcneNj7FE669Xrnr37HYJ9fjsbwb6K5Rigsud296wrMfQbQReLedoHbaHj3SM1gnkMeh
6. Sometimes you have to fillout the captcha, thats where Buster comes in. I suggest you create a Google API key for that.

I was too lazy to create a all in one solution because the pre-creation of the tokens could and is now easily fixed by CMv2. However, i still believe that having too many holders for an NFT is a bad thing. Sooo... have fun with this.

If you do not understand how this works, I don't really care and you should not be looking further into it.
